I'm Sahar Awaji. When I was pursuing my PhD, I was focused on integrating social physics, computational modeling, and statistics to understand social change. My dissertation delved into using entropy, a fundamental concept in thermodynamics and information theory, to analyze social dynamics. This interdisciplinary approach investigated the role of entropy in areas such as residential segregation, financial systems, and sentiment fluctuations in online social networks. Through agent-based modeling and sentiment analysis, my research aimed to enhance the understanding of complex social phenomena and provide practical insights for policymakers, urban planners, and social media experts.

For a list of my publications, see my Google Scholar or you can review my CV.
